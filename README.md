## Music Map Android Application
The application server-side uses Linux and Apache to load balancing. All the data are stored in MySQL and PHP is used to implement the dynamic query in the database. While communicating online, the server uses JSON as the data format to interact with the client.

The client-side of MusicMap is based on Android platform. The user can register an account to login. Then search for performance information and manage them. This application also takes advantage of Google Maps API so that the user can check performance information on a map.
